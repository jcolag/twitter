# Twitter Archive for @jcolag

With Twitter's (ahem) "interesting decisions," this repository holds my public Twitter history.  I hereby [license it](LICENSE.md) under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution Share-Alike 4.0 Internation license, with the following caveats.

 * Header images, except by occasional coincidence, where the original article happened to use a CC BY-SA-compatible image.
 * Retweets.
 * Article headlines from sources not made available under a Free Culture license.
 * Quotes from people whose works have not yet fallen into the public domain.

Those all *only* see inclusion here through Fair Use doctrine.

I should also mentioned that I generated this archive with [Tweetback](https://github.com/tweetback/tweetback).  It builds these sorts of websites based on files in the download supplied by Twitter when you request it.  If you feel comfortable with the command-line and running Node.js applications, I highly recommend doing the same, given the results provided by fairly minimal effort.
